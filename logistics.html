                We will use Piazza as the main form of communication and discussion within the course (note that we will not be using <a href="https://canvas.utexas.edu/">Canvas</a> in this course). Please make sure you sign up <a href="http://www.piazza.com/stanford/winter2020/biods220" target="_blank">here</a>. All course announcements will happen through Piazza. All communication with course staff should also happen through Piazza -- please create a private post if appropriate. We encourage active participation in student discussions on Piazza to enhance learning in the course.

                <h4>Student Presentations</h4>
                An integral component of this course is to conduct a literature review on robot learning research through student presentations and in-class discussions. Each student should expect to have at least <strong>two presentations</strong> regarding their assigned paper readings. To ensure the quality and clarity of the presentations, we expect the students to
                <ul>
                  <li>read the assigned papers thoroughly and gain a good understanding before making the presentation slides.<br><strong>Template:</strong> <a href="resources/presentation_template.pptx">[Powerpoint]</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zxXec0dpFGPHzpDy4mJLRsTacVvUjuSopyZimmIYoLk/edit?usp=sharing">[Google Slides]</a></li>
                  <li>email the slides to the TA seven days (EOD) prior to the presentation date for feedback and revision.<br><strong>Deadline:</strong> 11:59pm Tue for talks next Tue and 11:59pm Thu for talks next Thu</li>
                  <li>give a practice talk to the instructor on Friday 5:30-7pm in the previous week of their presentation date.<br><strong>Location:</strong> GDC 4.805</li>
                </ul>
                Failures to send the slides or attend the practice talks on time would incur a <strong>20% deduction</strong> on the presentation score. Each presentation should be <strong>30min</strong> (&plusmn; 2min). The presentation will be graded in the following aspects:
                <ul>
                  <li>Clarity of presentation (problem formulation, proposed method, key results);</li>
                  <li>Review of prior work and the challenges addressed by this work;</li>
                  <li>Analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the research;</li>
                  <li>Discussion of potential research extensions and applications;</li>
                  <li>Response to student questions (in-class and on Piazza).</li>
                </ul>
                After each presentation, we will do a <strong>5-10min</strong> in-class discussion about the work. The slides will be made public on the course website one week after the presentation date. The presentations will be each worth <strong>10%</strong> of the total grade. For students who present more than twice, their presentation grades will be the sum of the <strong>highest two</strong> scores.

                <h4>Paper Reviews</h4>
                A paper review will be due by 11:59pm the previous night for each class of student presentations (no review required for lecture dates). There will usually be 2-3 papers presented in each class. You need to pick <strong>only one</strong> paper among them to write a review. The paper reviews are in a similar review format as the <a href="https://roboticsconference.org/">RSS Conference</a>. The reviews are graded based on the level of understanding and critical analysis of the work. Please submit the reviews using the online form: <a href="https://forms.gle/tC2VQVj81rVdiVJh8">[Review Form]</a>
                <br><br>
                The reviews will be each worth <strong>1.5%</strong> of the total grade and <strong>20 reviews</strong> are required, summing up to <strong>30%</strong> of the total grade. The reviews will not be accepted late since we expect the students’ independent evaluations of the papers prior to in-class presentations and discussions. However, there are more than 20 presentation classes. It allows flexibility for students to skip some reviews due to personal conflicts, such as holy days, conference travel, etc. In the case when more than 20 reviews are submitted by a student, we will take the <strong>top-scored 20</strong> for grading. Note that <strong>class attendance and participation</strong> of the paper presentation are required in order to receive a non-zero grade of paper review.

                The course project aims to help the students gain in-depth, hands-on experiences applying AI-based techniques to practical robot perception and decision making problems. It consists of three key milestones: a project proposal (5%), a milestone report (10%), a final report (25%), and a spotlight talk (5%). For more detail, please see the <a href="project.html">Project</a> page.

                <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
                <p>You are encouraged to discuss assignments with classmates, but all collected data, analysis, images and graphs, and other written work must be your own. All programming assignments must be entirely your own except for teamwork on the final project. You may NOT look online for existing implementations of algorithms related to the programming assignments, even as a reference. Your code will be analyzed by automatic tools that detect plagiarism to ensure that it is original. For the final project, you have full access to the web, but all ideas, quotes, and code fragments that originate from elsewhere must be cited according to standard academic practice. <strong>Students caught cheating will automatically fail the course and will be reported to the university.</strong> If in doubt about the ethics of any particular action, look at the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/CodeOfConduct.html#honesty">departmental guidelines</a> and/or ask — ignorance of the rules will not shield you from potential consequences.</p>

                <h4>Notice about missed work due to religious holy days</h4>
                <p>A student who misses an examination, work assignment, or other projects due to the observance of a religious holy day will be given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence, provided that he or she has properly notified the instructor. It is the policy of the University of Texas at Austin that the student must notify the instructor at least fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates he or she will be absent to observe a religious holy day. For religious holy days that fall within the first two weeks of the semester, the notice should be given on the first day of the semester. The student will not be penalized for these excused absences, but the instructor may appropriately respond if the student fails to satisfactorily complete the missed assignment or examination within a reasonable time after the excused absence.</p>
