                The goal of the project is to provide an opportunity to gain in-depth experience developing an AI-based approach to a healthcare problem. Since a large part of the course is focused on deep learning approaches for biomedical data, we require that your project must involve training of at least one deep learning model on biomedical or more broadly healthcare-related data. To satisfy this requirement, simply re-running training of a model from an existing code repository is not
                sufficient; you must at minimum demonstrate the ability to perform thoughtful monitoring and analysis of the training process and hyperparameter selection. Beyond this requirement, the precise topic of your project is flexible to allow exploration of diverse interests.</p><p>
  You may work in groups of 1-3 on the project, and grades will be calibrated by group size. Your project may be related to research in another class project as long as permission is granted by instructors of both classes; however, you must clearly indicate in the project proposal, milestone, and final reports the exact portion of the project that is being counted for this course. In this case, you must prepare separate reports for each course, and submit your final report for the other course as
  well.</p><p>
  Following is a description of the project components that you will need to turn in, the grading rubric, as well as some suggestions for project ideas.</p>

                <h4>Project Proposal</h4>
                Your proposal should be a 0.5 - 1 page document, not including any figures if appropriate. The proposal should include the following (with grade breakdown):
                <ul>

                    <li>(25%) What methods do you plan to experiment with? If there are existing related implementations, will you use them and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations? This can be subject to change, but you should have a general sense of how you plan to approach the problem you are working on.</li>
                    <li>(25%) How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?</li>

                You may consult any papers, books, online references, or publicly available implementations for ideas and code that you may want to incorporate into your strategy or algorithm, so long as you clearly cite your sources in your code and your writeup. However, under no circumstances may you look at another group’s code or incorporate their code into your project. If you are combining your course project with the project from another class, you must also follow all guidelines for this as specified above.
